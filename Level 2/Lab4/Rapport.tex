\section{Preamble}

Assignment was to create a Bank which operated the way the lab described.

\section{The Code}
\subsection{placement}
I've decided to keep all files associated with the lab in the root of the project folder.
\subsection{Template memberfunction definitions}
Also relevant is it that I have actually defined all template class functions in a cpp file and instantialized with double there. So that the compiler actually would know which template to compile. (hope you know what i'm trying to say)

\begin{lstlisting}
	//bottom of DataFileReader.cpp
	template class DataFileReader<double>; //instantiating template with type double
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{namespace}
I chose to remove
\begin{lstlisting}
using namespace std;
\end{lstlisting}
from all files it was previously used in. I find that this improves readability and clearly seperates std functions from self-made ones.


Still I have not had the need (nor want) for a shared pointer. 

\section{conslusion}
I think this lab went well. And was alot easier than the previous ones (in a good way). Lots of new stuff learned but marginal amount of typing.


\section{Question}
Is it bad form to define the template member functions in the cpp files.

Was I correct in my approach?

\section{Building/Compiling}
Just run \emph{make} in the Lab directory.
To run the program run \emph{make run} in same directory.

\section{Enviroment}
I'm programming on an Arch linux 64-bit system. I've got the gcc compiler installed and compile using it's g++ alias which links necessary libraries automatically. To compile I use the recommended flags: "-std=c++11 -Wall -pedantic". The flags let me choose to use c++11 standard and give me useful compiling warnings and errors. 
For editing of code i currently use VS code with a makefile.
